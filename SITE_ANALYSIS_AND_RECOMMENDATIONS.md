  - Your workshop
  - Simulator setup
  - You working on clubs
  - Equipment and technology
  - Finished clubs

**Implementation:** Replace generic icons with real photos

---

#### 2. **Prominently Display Your Guarantee** ‚úÖ
**Current:** You mention "Satisfaction Guaranteed" in benefits
**Upgrade:** Make it a hero feature like GigaGolf's 30-day guarantee

**Suggested Wording:**
```
üèÜ 100% SATISFACTION GUARANTEE
If you're not completely satisfied with your fitting or custom clubs,
we'll make it right - no questions asked. Your perfect clubs, guaranteed.
```
