        <p>He walked in with a tidy set and a messy story. Evan is the kind of golfer who keeps his grips clean, his yardage book dog‑eared, his hopes reasonable. "I can't tell the difference between my 8‑iron and 9‑iron anymore," he said, not angry, just tired. "And my wedges feel like strangers. One flies forever, the next sits down like a scared rabbit."</p>

        <p>We dimmed the lights the way we always do, not to be dramatic but to let the screen and the swing do the talking. There's a heartbeat to a builder's shop at night—fans, the soft click of the launch monitor, a ferrule tapping the bench like a metronome. I put impact tape on his 9‑iron and 8‑iron, then the pitching wedge, gap, and sand. Same ball, same swing. We asked for ten shots with each club—normal swings, not audition swings—and we threw out the outliers without ceremony. Then the truth appeared in numbers that were somehow gentler than the scorecard had been: his 9‑iron and 8‑iron carried within three yards of each other. His gap wedge and sand wedge were a full club apart, like cousins who stopped talking.</p>

        <p>People think "gapping" is a spreadsheet thing. It isn't. It's a peace‑of‑mind thing. Your bag should read like a ladder you can climb—even rungs, no missing steps, no duplicates. On the course, it feels like this: you stand over a number and you already know which club says "I've got this," not "I might have this if the wind remembers to help."</p>

        <p>We started where gapping actually lives: carry distance, not total. Total changes with firm greens and cheeky slopes. Carry is the honest part. "Hit your normal," I told Evan, and he did—the way he would on a Tuesday evening with friends who tell the truth. His averages stacked up like a sentence with some words repeated and some words missing. We didn't scold the swing. We looked at the tools.</p>

        <p>There are a dozen ways a ladder gets crooked: modern "strong loft" sets that stretch the top and crush the middle, a pitching wedge stamped 45° pretending it's an old 9‑iron, a gap wedge that never got the memo, a sand wedge with a heavy head that launches high but goes sleepy in wind. Sometimes it's simpler: a factory tolerance drifted, or a loft moved a degree after a year of hard turf, or two clubs that were supposed to be four degrees apart were in fact…two.</p>

        <p>We rolled the loft/lie machine to the bench. This isn't magic; it's manners. We measure every club, not just the suspects. Evan's 8‑iron had crept half a degree stronger, the 9‑iron half a degree weaker, and there was the overlap he'd been living with—two rungs trying to occupy the same space. Down in the scoring end, his pitching wedge was a modern 45°, the gap wedge a soft 50°, and the sand wedge a true 56°. That's a fine spec if the carries live twelve to fifteen yards apart. His didn't. The 50° and 56° were a chasm. His half‑swings were guesswork. His full swings felt like dice.</p>

        <p>We bent the 8‑iron and 9‑iron into honest distance separation—no bravado, just the degrees they were meant to be. Then we rebuilt the wedge ladder the way I like to see it when a golfer wants clarity: 46–48° for the pitching wedge (depending on the set), then a 50–52° gap wedge, then 54–56°, and finally 58–60°, with the actual choices driven by the course (tight lies vs lush, firm vs soft) and the player (steep vs shallow, full‑swing vs partial). We didn't chase even numbers; we chased even carries.</p>

        <p>Back on the mat, we mapped reality. Ten‑ball sets, quietly. Pitching wedge, full and three‑quarter. Gap wedge, full, three‑quarter, and a little chippy nine‑to‑three motion. Sand wedge, same dance. The monitor doesn't need to shout; it just needs to be repeated. The pattern finally showed up like railroad ties: 8‑iron here, 9‑iron twelve yards below, pitching wedge another ten down, gap wedge another twelve, sand ten more, lob the last—no duplicates, no missing steps. Evan didn't grin. He exhaled. That's the tell in this work.</p>

        <h3>If you've never done it this way, here's the simple version you can take to the range this week:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Measure carries, not totals.</strong> Ten balls per club, normal swings, same ball, toss the two strangest. Write down the average carry and the height.</li>
            <li><strong>Look for duplicates and gaps.</strong> Two irons the same distance? A wedge jump that's a cliff? Circle them.</li>
            <li><strong>Check the spec, then the feel.</strong> Loft and lie tell you the map; your hands tell you if the club is asking for something you don't have.</li>
            <li><strong>Fix with tools, not hope.</strong> A 1° loft change can separate siblings. A lie adjustment can stop a start‑line from lying to you. A different wedge loft can stitch the scoring end into a sentence you can actually read under pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Name the partials.</strong> Own a three‑quarter wedge that flies a number on purpose. Own a nine‑to‑three. Don't audition them on 16. Learn them on a mat where your heartbeat isn't quite so loud.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Evan asked what everyone asks when the ladder looks straight: "What about bounce and grinds?" I told him the part I believe most: the sole is your turf insurance. Your attack angle and turf decide the bounce, not a catalog photo. If you're steep on soft ground, more bounce saves your soul; if you're shallow on tight lies, a slimmer sole keeps the leading edge from scaring you. But distance gapping lives in lofts and swings. First build the ladder. Then pick the shoes you want to climb it in.</p>

        <p>We took one last reading: 9‑iron at a carry he could count on, 8‑iron at a believable step above. Then the wedges, each one a sentence fragment that added up to a paragraph he could use. He didn't ask for miracles anymore; he asked for numbers he could love. That's the quiet romance of gapping—knowing how far your swing goes before you try to write poetry with it.</p>

        <p>Out on the course a week later, Evan texted me in the small voice golfers save for good news: "112 yards. Knew it was the gap wedge. Didn't think. Just swung." That's what fairness feels like in golf: not fireworks, just stories that read straight through.</p>

        <p>If your 8 and 9 keep arguing, if your 54° and 58° don't talk, if your half‑swings feel like auditions, bring the bag you own. We'll measure every loft and lie, bend what should bend, and map carries with your ball until your ladder climbs evenly from long iron to lob wedge. Then we'll write the three partials you actually use and leave the heroics to Saturday mornings.</p>
