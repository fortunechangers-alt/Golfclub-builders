                He kept the bucket under the bench like a secret. Late after work, lights humming over the range, Cal lined up a 7-iron the way he had a thousand times‚Äîfeet squared, breath held, jaw set. The first ball started on the flag and then, like so many lately, faded weak and fell short. The next went higher but thinner, a stinging reminder in his hands. He wasn't lost, exactly. Just‚Ä¶ untethered.
            </p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                Truth was, Cal hadn't changed much. Two kids, long days, less practice. But something about his irons felt different‚Äîfloaty on good days, jittery on bad ones, as if the head arrived a fraction early or late and he was always negotiating at impact. He blamed tempo, grip pressure, tempo again. He never blamed the clubs. His father had taught him that the club is honest; it tells you the truth. So when it lied every third swing, Cal wondered if the lie was his.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                A friend insisted: "Go see the builder."
            </p>

            <h2 style="color: var(--deep-green); font-size: 2rem; margin: 3rem 0 1.5rem 0; border-bottom: 2px solid var(--light); padding-bottom: 0.5rem;">The Discovery</h2>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                The workbench was a shrine to small miracles‚Äîsolvent and ferrules, a rack of heads winking under fluorescent light, a swing-weight scale like a quiet judge. The builder measured Cal's irons and raised an eyebrow. The 7-iron sat at D0, the 9-iron at D4, the 5-iron barely C9. Not broken. Not ideal. A set that would ask for three different tempos in three different places.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                "Let's try something," the builder said, soft as a confession. He added two tiny squares of weight‚Äîfour grams total‚Äîto the back of the 7-iron. A little rule of thumb: around +2 grams at the head ‚âà +1 swing-weight point. The scale settled at D2. "Swing this."
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                Cal did, and the sound changed. <em>Thunk</em>, not clink. The ball climbed and held a truer line. It wasn't farther. It was cleaner. The second swing started slightly on the toe‚Äîand still flew useful. His left eyebrow lifted without permission.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                "What did you do?"
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                "Gave your hands something to follow," the builder said. "Right now your long irons feel too light‚Äîthey run ahead of your body and you're chasing them with your hands. The short irons feel too heavy‚Äîyou steer them. We'll meet you in the middle."
            </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Swing weight is not total weight. It's how heavy the club feels while swinging, the balance of head vs. handle, measured on a 14-inch fulcrum swing-weight scale.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                They moved in small steps. A couple grams at the head here, a half-point there. Heavier grip on the wedge to steady the hands (add roughly +5 g in the grip ‚âà ‚àí1 point on the scale, a neat counterbalance trick). No lectures, no jargon storm. Just hits and quiet yes or quiet no. When he tried too heavy‚Äîa clumsy D6‚Äîhis transition got thick and late, like he was dragging luggage through mud. So they backed away. When it was right‚ÄîD2‚ÄìD3 in the mid-irons, a whisper more in the wedge‚Äîthe club felt like it waited for him, then went with him.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                On the walk to the car, the range lights buzzed, the grass wore that summer-night perfume men remember for years. Cal set a ball down one more time with the tuned 7-iron. His practice swing had a new metronome in it. He didn't try to make speed; he let weight make timing. The ball leapt, rose on the flag, and sat. He laughed‚Äînot loud, but from somewhere old and good.
            </p>

            <h2 style="color: var(--deep-green); font-size: 2rem; margin: 3rem 0 1.5rem 0; border-bottom: 2px solid var(--light); padding-bottom: 0.5rem;">The Results</h2>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                Over the next few weeks, the changes proved real. His worst swings weren't catastrophic. His best ones stopped feeling like accidents. The 5-iron that used to skid and leak right now started on line and stayed brave. The wedge that once dove left when he got handsy now held the face and clipped shots with a proper flight. Yardages got honest. And with honesty came something men don't talk about enough: relief. The relief of not explaining yourself to a game that doesn't listen.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                Swing weight didn't turn Cal into someone else. It took who he already was‚Äîthe tempo he had, the strength he'd kept‚Äîand made it repeatable. There's romance in distance, sure. But there's a deeper romance in trust. When the club's weight is right, you stop bargaining with impact. You stop flinching. You just swing.

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-size: 1.1rem;">If you've had that floaty-then-heavy feeling, if your mid-iron goes to two different places with the same swing, if you've been blaming grip pressure and tempo for months‚Äîmaybe your swing is fine. Maybe your balance is off.</p>
