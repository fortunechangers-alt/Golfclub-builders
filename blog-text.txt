Maya and Dan: When Labels Meet Reality

They arrived together on a windy Thursday—Maya with a canvas tote full of range tokens, Dan with the kind of grin that says, "I'm here for her, but I'm definitely going to swing something." He carried a men's Stiff driver he'd trusted since college; she held a boxed women's set her sister had sworn by. They wanted me to confirm what the labels already seemed to promise.

I didn't. I asked them to hit balls.

Our shop is quiet on purpose. You can hear the launch monitor wake up, the small fan over the mat, the way a centered strike makes a soft, round note that feels like truth in your hands. Maya went first. Her tempo was smooth, unhurried, the kind of rhythm you see in someone who can walk a hill without changing breath. Her speed was real—faster than she believed—and the ball rose with a bright, confident window when she caught the middle. Dan stepped up next and swung the way men are taught to swing: harder when unsure, firmer when the ball doesn't listen. His best was a postcard. His average lived a little right and a little low; by the end of ten balls, his shoulders had crept into his ears.
