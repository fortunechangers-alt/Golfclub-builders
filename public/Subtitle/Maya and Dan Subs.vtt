00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.125
<b>Maya and Dan, when labels meet reality.</b>

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.875
<b>They arrived together</b>

3
00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:05.875
<b>on a windy Thursday,</b>

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.166
<b>Maya with a canvas tote full of range</b>

5
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.666
<b>tokens, Dan with the</b>

6
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:10.916
<b>kind of grin that says,</b>

7
00:00:11.708 --> 00:00:13.666
<b>"I'm here for her, but I'm definitely</b>

8
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:14.791
<b>going to swing something."</b>

9
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.916
<b>He carried a men's stiff driver he'd</b>

10
00:00:17.916 --> 00:00:19.333
<b>trusted since college.</b>

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.500
<b>She held a boxed women's set</b>

12
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.666
<b>her sister had sworn by. They wanted me</b>

13
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:25.958
<b>to confirm what the labels</b>

14
00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.416
<b>already seemed to promise.</b>

15
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.916
<b>"I didn't. I asked them to hit balls. Our</b>

16
00:00:30.916 --> 00:00:32.208
<b>shop is quiet on purpose.</b>

17
00:00:32.708 --> 00:00:34.625
<b>You can hear the launch monitor wake up,</b>

18
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.375
<b>the small fan over the mat,</b>

19
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.500
<b>the way a centred strike makes a soft,</b>

20
00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:39.791
<b>round note that feels</b>

21
00:00:39.791 --> 00:00:41.000
<b>like truth in your hands."</b>

22
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:44.625
<b>Maya went first. Her temper was smooth,</b>

23
00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:46.666
<b>unhurried, the kind of rhythm you see in</b>

24
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:47.958
<b>someone who can walk a hill without</b>

25
00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:50.416
<b>changing breath. Her speed</b>

26
00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:52.375
<b>was real, faster than she</b>

27
00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:54.291
<b>believed, and the ball rose with a</b>

28
00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:55.416
<b>bright, confident window</b>

29
00:00:55.416 --> 00:00:56.458
<b>when she caught the middle.</b>

30
00:00:57.125 --> 00:00:59.875
<b>Dan stepped up next and swung the way men</b>

31
00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:02.208
<b>are taught to swing, harder when unsure,</b>

32
00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:05.083
<b>firmer when the ball doesn't listen. His</b>

33
00:01:05.083 --> 00:01:06.958
<b>best was a postcard. His</b>

34
00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.458
<b>average lived a little right and</b>

35
00:01:08.458 --> 00:01:10.458
<b>a little low. By the end of ten balls,</b>

36
00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:12.625
<b>his shoulders had crept into his ears.</b>

37
00:01:13.541 --> 00:01:15.708
<b>"Tell us about men's versus women's</b>

38
00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:17.708
<b>clubs," he said, "which is how this</b>

39
00:01:17.708 --> 00:01:19.000
<b>conversation always begins.</b>

40
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.583
<b>So I told them the simple, accurate</b>

41
00:01:21.583 --> 00:01:25.125
<b>version." What the labels usually mean.</b>

42
00:01:27.208 --> 00:01:28.916
<b>Clubs sold as women's are typically</b>

43
00:01:28.916 --> 00:01:30.833
<b>shorter, lighter overall,</b>

44
00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:32.416
<b>and use softer flexes than</b>

45
00:01:32.416 --> 00:01:34.791
<b>their men's counterparts. Grips are</b>

46
00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:35.750
<b>usually smaller in</b>

47
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.166
<b>diameter. Lofts may be slightly</b>

48
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:41.125
<b>higher to help launch. Women's drivers,</b>

49
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.500
<b>for instance, are</b>

50
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.583
<b>often about an inch shorter</b>

51
00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:46.291
<b>than standard men's models, and the irons</b>

52
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:47.500
<b>scale down similarly.</b>

53
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.291
<b>That's a decent starting point</b>

54
00:01:50.291 --> 00:01:52.041
<b>for many smaller or smoother tempo</b>

55
00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:54.958
<b>golfers of any gender, because shorter</b>

56
00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.375
<b>and lighter can make timing</b>

57
00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:59.750
<b>easier and launch more honest. What the</b>

58
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.666
<b>labels do not mean. They do</b>

59
00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:04.125
<b>not mean men must always play</b>

60
00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:05.875
<b>men's clubs or that women must always</b>

61
00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:07.458
<b>play women's. They don't</b>

62
00:02:07.458 --> 00:02:09.000
<b>mean every woman needs an L,</b>

63
00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:11.791
<b>ladies, flex, or that every man belongs</b>

69

<b>or your confidence. Labels are</b>

70
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.791
<b>scaffolding. Fit is a house. We put</b>

71
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:31.416
<b>Meyer's boxed set aside for a</b>

72
00:02:31.416 --> 00:02:33.708
<b>moment and built a test club in a regular</b>

73
00:02:33.708 --> 00:02:35.041
<b>flex with a mid-weight shaft</b>

74
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:37.000
<b>firmer than the L in the box</b>

75
00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:39.375
<b>and a standard diameter grip instead of</b>

76
00:02:39.375 --> 00:02:40.958
<b>the undersize. She took</b>

77
00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.375
<b>one breath and sent a drive</b>

78
00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:46.208
<b>with a calm draw that looked like the</b>

79
00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:47.958
<b>line you'd sketch if you</b>

80
00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.500
<b>could draw a perfect shot.</b>

81
00:02:49.541 --> 00:02:53.833
<b>She laughed, surprised, and a little</b>

82
00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:56.583
<b>proud because the ball does not care what</b>

83
00:02:56.583 --> 00:02:57.500
<b>it says on the shrink</b>

84
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.750
<b>wrap. Dan's turn. He lived on a knife</b>

85
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.125
<b>edge with the stiff, best</b>

86
00:03:02.125 --> 00:03:03.541
<b>swings, pure enough bullets,</b>

87
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.125
<b>ordinary swings, low right compromises.</b>

88
00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:08.583
<b>So we tested a slightly</b>

89
00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:10.125
<b>lighter shaft with a regular</b>

90
00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:12.333
<b>flex in his driver and trimmed length</b>

91
00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:15.458
<b>down half an inch. So his timing didn't</b>

92
00:03:15.458 --> 00:03:16.458
<b>have to sprint to keep</b>

93
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.000
<b>up. The change wasn't dramatic. It was</b>

94
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.916
<b>better. The low rights</b>

95
00:03:21.916 --> 00:03:23.541
<b>became mid-window pushes that</b>

96
00:03:23.541 --> 00:03:25.666
<b>curved back. He could make the same move</b>

97
00:03:25.666 --> 00:03:26.625
<b>and expect the same</b>

98
00:03:26.625 --> 00:03:29.000
<b>answer. Two shots in a row.</b>

99
00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:34.583
<b>That's not a miracle. That's fit. We</b>

100
00:03:34.583 --> 00:03:35.833
<b>talked through the levers.</b>

101
00:03:35.833 --> 00:03:36.875
<b>We can pull the honest ones.</b>

102
00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.083
<b>Length, shorter isn't less at its</b>

103
00:03:41.083 --> 00:03:42.083
<b>leverage. You can time.</b>

104
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.875
<b>Most misses live at the ends.</b>

105
00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:47.041
<b>Too long pulls the club off plane and</b>

106
00:03:47.041 --> 00:03:49.416
<b>delays the face. Too short can make you</b>

107
00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:50.416
<b>hunch and lose speed.</b>

108
00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:53.000
<b>We fit length to height, posture,</b>

109
00:03:53.916 --> 00:03:55.250
<b>delivery, and where you actually strike</b>

110
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.375
<b>the face not to a label.</b>

111
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.625
<b>Total weight versus swing weight. Total</b>

112
00:03:59.625 --> 00:04:00.708
<b>weight is what you carry</b>

113
00:04:00.708 --> 00:04:02.708
<b>for 18 holes. Swing weight</b>

114
00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:05.791
<b>is how heavy the club feels in motion. A</b>

115
00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:07.458
<b>women's club cut down from</b>

116
00:04:07.458 --> 00:04:08.791
<b>a men's shaft without adding</b>

117
00:04:08.833 --> 00:04:12.125
<b>head weight often goes too light in swing</b>

118
00:04:12.125 --> 00:04:13.708
<b>weight. The head</b>

119
00:04:13.708 --> 00:04:15.375
<b>disappears. Timing evaporates.</b>

120
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.625
<b>If we shorten, we adjust the balance so</b>

121
00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:20.583
<b>the club still talks to your hands.</b>

122
00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:24.291
<b>Flex and profile. Flex letters.</b>

123
00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:29.791
<b>L-A-M-R-S-X-T-X are rough ladders. Tempo</b>

124
00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:31.000
<b>matters as much as speed.</b>

125
00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.708
<b>Smooth transitions can live in softer</b>

126
00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:35.250
<b>options with great results.</b>

127
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.583
<b>Punchy transitions often need firmer tips</b>

128
00:04:37.583 --> 00:04:39.208
<b>or more mass. So the</b>

129
00:04:39.208 --> 00:04:40.625
<b>face shows up on time.</b>

130
00:04:41.541 --> 00:04:43.458
<b>Grip size, hands decide. Too small and</b>

131
00:04:43.458 --> 00:04:45.250
<b>you squeeze. Too big and</b>

132
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.333
<b>you lose face awareness.</b>

133
00:04:47.041 --> 00:04:50.083
<b>We measure hand size and test. A lot of</b>

134
00:04:50.083 --> 00:04:51.958
<b>women land in standard or mid</b>

135
00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.583
<b>depending on feel and build.</b>

136
00:04:54.208 --> 00:04:58.000
<b>Not a preset lady's size. Plenty of men</b>

137
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.958
<b>with smaller hands play</b>

138
00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.750
<b>undersize. Loft gapping.</b>

139
00:05:01.208 --> 00:05:03.458
<b>If a women's model has a touch more loft</b>

140
00:05:03.458 --> 00:05:05.041
<b>and lighter shafts,</b>

141
00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:07.708
<b>carries will change. We gap from</b>

142
00:05:07.708 --> 00:05:10.208
<b>the top of the bag to the wedges so there</b>

143
00:05:10.208 --> 00:05:11.666
<b>are no missing sentences in your</b>

<b>distances. Back on the</b>

145
00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:15.333
<b>mat, Maya tried a stiff and a lighter</b>

146
00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:17.750
<b>weight just to see it. The ball still</b>

147
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.583
<b>flew. But the feel got</b>

148
00:05:19.583 --> 00:05:21.833
<b>uptight. The club didn't load as</b>

149
00:05:21.833 --> 00:05:24.166
<b>willingly and her draw began to hang on</b>

150
00:05:24.166 --> 00:05:25.250
<b>the right side of the range.</b>

151
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.458
<b>She shook her head, honest with herself.</b>

152
00:05:29.083 --> 00:05:31.125
<b>That regular felt like it wanted to help.</b>

153
00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:34.833
<b>Dan, meanwhile, tried to prove the stiff</b>

154

<b>was still his. He found two perfect ones,</b>

155
00:05:38.333 --> 00:05:40.916
<b>then chased them, then lost them. He put</b>

00:05:40.916 --> 00:05:41.958
<b>the regular back down</b>

157
00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:42.666
<b>like someone choosing</b>

158
00:05:43.125 --> 00:05:45.958
<b>a boot that fits instead of one that</b>

159
00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.166
<b>flatters at the store mirror.</b>

160
00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:50.375
<b>Here are the truths I</b>

161
00:05:50.375 --> 00:05:51.333
<b>send home with couples.</b>

162
00:05:51.833 --> 00:05:55.208
<b>There is no such thing as men's distance</b>

163
00:05:55.208 --> 00:05:56.291
<b>or women's forgiveness.</b>

164
00:05:57.125 --> 00:05:58.208
<b>There's only the club that</b>

165
00:05:58.208 --> 00:06:00.625
<b>fits the way you swing. Cut downs aren't</b>

166
00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:01.791
<b>free. If you shorten a</b>

167
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:03.041
<b>club and don't rebalance it,</b>

168
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.500
<b>the swing weight craters and the head</b>

169
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.875
<b>vanishes. We add the right</b>

<b>grams back where they belong.</b>

171
00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:13.791
<b>TX is not a trophy. It's for tour level</b>

<b>speed with an aggressive</b>

173
00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:16.125
<b>transition. Most golfers,</b>

174

<b>men and women, play better golf in R or S</b>

175
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:20.916
<b>when the weight and tip</b>
