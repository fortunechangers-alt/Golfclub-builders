# üöÄ ACTUAL WORKING DEPLOYMENT PROCESS

## ‚úÖ HOW DEPLOYMENT ACTUALLY WORKS (CONFIRMED WORKING)

### The Process That Actually Works:

**When you need to deploy changes:**

1. **Make changes locally** to any files
2. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add [files]
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   ```
3. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
4. **THAT'S IT!** The site updates automatically within seconds.

### Example (AI Fitting Icon - October 15, 2025):
```bash
cd /Users/willisfamily/Movies/CacheClip/audio/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/Projects/golf_builders_2
git add app/Views/home/index.php public/images/ai-fitting-icon.png
git commit -m "Optimize AI fitting icon - reduced file size and made icon 80% to not fill circle completely"
git push origin main
# ‚úÖ Site updated automatically! Confirmed at https://golfclub-builders.com
```

## üîç How It Works Behind The Scenes

There is an **automatic deployment system** already configured that:
1. Watches for pushes to the GitHub repository
2. Automatically pulls the latest code to the live server
3. Updates permissions correctly
4. Does NOT break the PHP version (PHP 8.4 stays active)

**Possible mechanisms:**
- GitHub webhook calling `webhook-deploy.php` on the server
- Hosting provider's built-in git deployment
- Some other automated system

**The important thing:** IT WORKS! Don't touch it, don't "fix" it, just use it.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: NEVER USE CPANEL TERMINAL FOR DEPLOYMENT

**Why?** Because running git commands in cPanel Terminal somehow changes the PHP version away from 8.4, breaking the site.

**The automatic system handles everything correctly.** Just commit and push to GitHub.

## üìã Common Deployment Scenarios

### Deploy a Single File Change:
```bash
git add path/to/file.php
git commit -m "Fix: Description of fix"
git push origin main
```

### Deploy Multiple Files:
```bash
git add file1.php file2.css file3.js
git commit -m "Update: Description"
git push origin main
```

### Deploy Everything (be careful!):
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update: Description"
git push origin main
```

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

After pushing, verify deployment worked:

1. **Check the file exists on server:**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://golfclub-builders.com/path/to/file
   ```
   Should return `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`

2. **Check HTML was updated:**
   ```bash
   curl -s https://golfclub-builders.com | grep "search-term"
   ```

3. **Visit the live site** in a browser (use incognito mode to bypass cache)

---

## üéØ CSS/JS Cache Busting

When updating CSS or JavaScript files, increment the version number in the header:

**File:** `app/Views/layout/header.php`

```php
<link rel="stylesheet" href="<?= base_url('css/style.min.css?v=2.3') ?>">
<script src="<?= base_url('js/main.min.js?v=2.3') ?>"></script>
```

Change `?v=2.3` to `?v=2.4` to force browsers to reload the file.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If Changes Don't Appear:
1. **Check if commit was pushed:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -5
   ```
   Should show your recent commit.

2. **Check if push succeeded:**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   Should say "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'"

3. **Check deployment log on server** (if you have access):
   ```bash
   tail -20 /home/golfclub/public_html/deploy.log
   ```

4. **Clear browser cache** or use incognito mode

### If PHP Version Changed (RARE):
The automatic system should prevent this, but if it happens:
- The `.htaccess` file forces PHP 8.4
- Check: https://golfclub-builders.com (if it loads, PHP is fine)
- If broken: Contact hosting provider to verify PHP 8.4

## üìû For The AI Agent

**When user says:**
- "Deploy this" ‚Üí Commit and push to GitHub
- "Push to live" ‚Üí Commit and push to GitHub  
- "Update the site" ‚Üí Commit and push to GitHub
- "Make it live" ‚Üí Commit and push to GitHub

**NEVER:**
- Tell user to use cPanel Terminal
- Provide manual git commands for cPanel
- Suggest "one-time fixes" in cPanel

**ALWAYS:**
- Use the git commit + push workflow
- Verify deployment with curl commands
- Confirm changes are live
