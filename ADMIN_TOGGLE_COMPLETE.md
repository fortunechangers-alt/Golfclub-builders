All requested features have been successfully implemented:

### ✅ Database Changes
- Added `is_admin` field to the `users` table
- Default value: `0` (not admin)
- Value `1` = admin access granted
- Currently 3 users set as admins: users #1, #3, and #4

### ✅ Access Control

- Applied filter to all `/admin/*` routes
- Non-admin users are redirected with error message
- Non-logged-in users redirected to `/login`

### ✅ View Toggle System

- Event listener sets `view_mode = 'customer'` on login
- Admins must manually click "Switch to Admin View" to access admin panel

### ✅ UI Updates
- **Frontend Header (Customer View)**: Shows "🔄 Switch to Admin View" button for admins
- **Admin Header (Admin View)**: Shows "🔄 Switch to Customer View" button
- Toggle buttons only visible when `is_admin = 1`

## 🛠️ Making Users Admins

### Current Admins:
- User #1: `admin` ✅
- User #3: `testadmin` ✅
- User #4: `Fortunechangers` ✅

### To Make More Admins:

**By User ID:**
```bash
mysql -u root -e "UPDATE golf_builders.users SET is_admin = 1 WHERE id = 5;"
```

**By Username:**
```bash
mysql -u root -e "UPDATE golf_builders.users SET is_admin = 1 WHERE username = 'john_doe';"
```

**To Remove Admin Access:**
```bash
mysql -u root -e "UPDATE golf_builders.users SET is_admin = 0 WHERE id = 5;"
```

**View All Users and Admin Status:**
```bash
php spark db:table users
```
