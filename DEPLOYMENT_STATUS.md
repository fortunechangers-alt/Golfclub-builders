## ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPLOYMENT TO LIVE SITE

### Current Status: **NEEDS MANUAL DEPLOYMENT**

The automated deployment script (`simple-deploy.php`) is not responding on the live site (404 error). 

### Option 1: Manual Deployment via cPanel (RECOMMENDED)

You need to access cPanel Terminal and run this command **ONE TIME**:

```bash
cd /home/golfclub/public_html && git fetch --all && git reset --hard origin/main && chmod -R 755 app && chmod -R 775 writable
```

**What this does:**
- Pulls the latest code from GitHub (including all our audio fixes)
- Deploys to the live site
- Sets correct file permissions
- Also uploads the `simple-deploy.php` file for future automated deployments

### Option 2: Upload simple-deploy.php First

If you want to use automated deployments in the future:

1. Upload `simple-deploy.php` to `/home/golfclub/public_html/`
2. Then you can deploy with just: `curl "https://golfclub-builders.com/simple-deploy.php?key=deploy123"`

## üìã What Will Be Deployed

When you run the deployment, these changes will go live:

### 1. Hero Animation Sound Fix
- Sound will play at frame 21 when scrolling down the homepage
- Animation runs over 29 frames
- Proper audio autoplay handling (waits for user interaction)

### 2. New Assets
- 29 animation frame images (golf ball sequence)
- 2 audio files (14KB ball drop sounds)

### 3. Updated Code
- `main.js` with complete animation functionality
- Cache-busting version parameters (v=2.3, v=14k)
- Updated footer to load correct JavaScript file

## üß™ Testing After Deployment

1. **Visit**: https://golfclub-builders.com
2. **Open browser console** (F12 ‚Üí Console)
3. **Scroll down slowly**
4. **Watch for logs**:
   ```
   Frame: 21 Progress: 0.71
   üîä TRIGGERING SOUND at frame 21

   ```
