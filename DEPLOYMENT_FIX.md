# Deployment Fix for Character Encoding Issues

## Problem
Your live server is showing encoding conversion warnings when uploading files.

## Solution Applied
1. ✅ Created `.htaccess` file with proper UTF-8 settings
2. ✅ Fixed encoding for all 4,578 PHP files (removed BOM, ensured UTF-8)
3. ✅ Converted CSS file to UTF-8 encoding

## Files to Upload to Live Server

### 1. Upload the new `.htaccess` file
- Upload `.htaccess` to your `/public_html/` directory
- This sets proper UTF-8 encoding and security headers

### 2. Re-upload these key files (in UTF-8):
- `app/Views/layout/footer.php`
- `app/Views/layout/header.php` 
- `public/css/style.css`
- All other PHP files (already fixed)

### 3. Server Configuration (if you have access)

If you have cPanel or server access, also check:

#### In cPanel File Manager:
1. Go to File Manager
2. Navigate to your domain's public_html folder
3. Look for "Character Encoding" or "Encoding" settings
4. Set to UTF-8

#### In .htaccess (already included):
```apache
AddDefaultCharset UTF-8
```

## Alternative: Disable Encoding Check

If the encoding warnings persist and don't affect functionality:

1. In your hosting control panel, look for "File Manager" settings
2. Find "Encoding Check" or "Character Set" options
3. Disable the encoding conversion dialog
4. This will prevent the warning from appearing

## Verification

After uploading:
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Visit your live site
3. Check that the footer displays correctly
4. Verify no encoding warnings appear

## If Issues Persist

1. Check server error logs in `/public_html/writable/logs/`
2. Contact your hosting provider about UTF-8 support
3. Consider using a different FTP client that preserves encoding

## Files Modified
- `.htaccess` (new)
- All PHP files (encoding fixed)
- `public/css/style.css` (converted to UTF-8)
- `fix_encoding.php` (temporary script - can be deleted after deployment)
