# üéØ Soft Opening - Available Time Slots Guide

## Overview
Your booking system now has a **Soft Opening Mode** where:
- ‚úÖ **All times are blocked by default**
- ‚úÖ **You manually open specific time slots**
- ‚úÖ **Customers only see the slots you've made available**
- ‚úÖ **Perfect for controlled soft opening with introductory pricing**

---

## How It Works

### For Customers (Public)
- When they visit `/booking`, they can only see time slots that YOU have opened
- If no slots are available for a date, they'll see "No time slots available yet"
- They can only book the times you've specifically made available

### For You (Admin)
- You control 100% of which slots are bookable
- You can activate/deactivate slots without deleting them
- You can see how many bookings each slot has
- You can open multiple slots at once

## üîÑ Workflow for Soft Opening

3. **Week 3**: Open 8 slots per day
4. **Week 4**: Open more times, adjust based on demand

### Gradual Pricing Increase
1. **First 50 bookings**: $149 (add note: "Early bird")
2. **Next 50**: $179 (note: "Intro price")
3. **After that**: $199 (note: "Regular price")

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Slots vs Bookings
- **Available Slots** = Times you've opened for booking
- **Bookings** = Actual customer reservations
- You manage slots, customers create bookings

### Deleting Slots
- You can only delete slots that **haven't been booked**
- If a slot has bookings, deactivate it instead
- This protects existing customer reservations

### Fully Booked Slots
- Shows as red background
- Stays in your list so you can track it
- Automatically hidden from customers
- You can see the booking count (1/1 means full)
