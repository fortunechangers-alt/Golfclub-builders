# Audio Seeking Issue - Research Prompt for ChatGPT

I'm building a blog with HTML5 audio players that have word-by-word highlighting synchronized with audio (like ElevenLabs karaoke). I have a critical issue where **audio seeking doesn't work** - it always resets to the beginning.

## CURRENT SETUP

### Audio Player HTML:
```html
<audio id="blogAudio" controls preload="auto" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    <source src="audio-file.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
```

### JavaScript for Click-to-Seek:
```javascript
// Word highlighting spans with data-word-index attributes
wordElements.forEach((element) => {
    element.addEventListener('click', function() {
        const wordIndex = parseInt(element.getAttribute('data-word-index'));
        if (allWords[wordIndex]) {
            const seekTime = allWords[wordIndex].start; // e.g., 45.5 seconds
            
            // Check if audio is ready for seeking
            if (audio.readyState >= 3) {
                audio.currentTime = seekTime;
                audio.play();
            } else {
                // Wait for audio to be ready
                audio.addEventListener('canplaythrough', function onReady() {
                    audio.removeEventListener('canplaythrough', onReady);
                    audio.currentTime = seekTime;
                    audio.play();
                });
                audio.load();
            }
        }
    });
});
```

### Event Listeners:
```javascript
audio.addEventListener('play', function() {
    isPlaying = true;
    requestAnimationFrame(tick);
});

audio.addEventListener('pause', function() {
    isPlaying = false;
});

audio.addEventListener('ended', function() {
    isPlaying = false;
    wordElements.forEach(el => el.classList.remove('active-word'));
    lastWordIndex = -1;
});

audio.addEventListener('seeked', function() {
    lastWordIndex = -1;
    wordElements.forEach(el => el.classList.remove('active-word'));
});
```

## THE PROBLEM

**Issue 1: Manual scrubber seeking**
- When I click/drag the audio player's scrubber bar to seek to minute 2:00
- The playhead appears to move to 2:00
- But when I press play, it starts from 0:00 (beginning)
- This happens EVERY TIME - cannot seek manually at all

**Issue 2: Click-to-seek on words**
- When I click on a word in the middle of the article (e.g., word #500)
- The audio starts playing from 0:00 (beginning)
- The `audio.currentTime = seekTime;` line appears to be ignored
- Or it's being reset somewhere

**Issue 3: Consistency**
- This happens in both Chrome and Safari
- This happens on both blog posts
- Audio files are 11-12MB MP3s, hosted locally
- Files are served via PHP/CodeIgniter framework

## WHAT I'VE TRIED

✅ Added `preload="auto"` to audio tag  
✅ Added `readyState` check before seeking  
✅ Added `canplaythrough` event listener fallback  
✅ Used `audio.load()` to trigger loading  
✅ Removed any code that might reset `currentTime`  
✅ Hard refreshed the browser (Cmd+Shift+R)  

**None of these worked** - audio always starts from 0:00.

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

- **Framework:** CodeIgniter 4 (PHP)
- **Audio files:** MP3 format, 11-12MB, 9-15 minutes long
- **Served via:** `<?= base_url('audio/file.mp3') ?>` (local XAMPP server)
- **Browsers tested:** Chrome (latest), Safari (latest) on macOS
- **File location:** `public/audio/Players Irons vs Game Improvement Irons.mp3`

## POSSIBLE CAUSES I'M CONSIDERING

1. **Event listener conflict?** - Maybe the `play` or `seeked` event is resetting `currentTime`?
2. **Server issue?** - Maybe the server doesn't support HTTP range requests for seeking?
3. **Audio file issue?** - Maybe the MP3 encoding prevents seeking?
4. **JavaScript timing?** - Maybe `currentTime` is set but then immediately reset?
5. **Browser restriction?** - Maybe there's a security policy preventing programmatic seeking?

## WHAT I NEED

I need you to:

1. **Research** the most common causes of this exact issue (audio seeking failing, resetting to beginning)
2. **Find** the proper solution used by production websites (like ElevenLabs, SoundCloud, etc.)
3. **Provide** working JavaScript code that:
   - Allows manual scrubber seeking (user can click timeline to jump)
   - Allows programmatic seeking (clicking words sets currentTime)
   - Works across Chrome and Safari
   - Handles large MP3 files (10-15MB)
   - Works with local file serving

4. **Explain** step-by-step why my current code doesn't work and what needs to change

## CONSTRAINTS

- Cannot change the audio file format (must stay MP3)
- Cannot upload to external CDN (must be locally hosted)
- Need it to work on both desktop and mobile
- Must work with CodeIgniter PHP framework URLs

## EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

**What should happen:**
1. User clicks at 2:00 on the audio scrubber → plays from 2:00 ✅
2. User clicks word #500 → audio seeks to that word's timestamp and plays ✅
3. User can freely seek back and forth using scrubber ✅
4. Seeking works instantly without waiting ✅

**What actually happens:**
1. User clicks at 2:00 → playhead appears at 2:00 but plays from 0:00 ❌
2. User clicks word #500 → plays from 0:00 ❌
3. Cannot seek at all - always forced to start from beginning ❌

## QUESTION

**Why does `audio.currentTime = X` not work, and how do I fix it properly?**

Please provide a complete, tested solution with explanation of the root cause.
