## Desktop Protection

**All changes are wrapped in media queries:**
- `@media (max-width: 768px)` - Tablets and phones
- `@media (max-width: 480px)` - Small phones

**Desktop (screens wider than 768px) remains completely unchanged.**

## Files Modified

1. **`/public/css/style.css`**
   - Added ~480 lines of mobile-specific CSS
   - All changes in media queries only
   - Desktop styles untouched

2. **`/public/js/main.js`**
   - Enhanced mobile menu toggle functionality
   - Added auto-close when clicking nav links
   - Hamburger animation support

3. **`/app/Views/layout/header.php`**
   - Already had hamburger button (no changes needed)
   - Logo height already set (compatible with mobile CSS)
